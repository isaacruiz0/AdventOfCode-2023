Game Info - Each game has a subset of cubes that were grabbed during that game
Goal - Return the gameId such that it did NOT contain a subset of cubes that would be impossible if LOADED_BAG is true

1. Grab the game id for each line
2. Grab each subsetGames, loop through each one and check if one of their properties is higher than its corresponding value in the loaded bagt
3. Only return the game id if the set of cubes is possible
4. If it is true that the return is !NaN then we can add the value to the array
5. Then we can get the sum of each item in the array(valid game ids)
